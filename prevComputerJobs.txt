Hi. My name is MiKe. I am an aspiring tech programmer/architect/engineer. I am interested in your computer science lessons to help me more better & broadly understand programming & computers in general. I am currently taking lessons in Solidity, with plans to take future courses in Python, JavaScript & AI. Would you be able to help me understand computer science relative to these programming languages?
I need help with creating a web application from scratch for my university graduation project. Just to clarify it is not a request to do it for me, but more with me during the class, or reviewing what I've already done myself, correcting it, etc. Let me know if this is smth you can help me with and if you have the capacity rn for classes with me 3xtimes per week. Thank you!
