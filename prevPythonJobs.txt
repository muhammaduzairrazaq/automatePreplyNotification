I am looking for a Python tutor who can help me learn and understand data structures and algorithms for Python coding interviews. Is this something you are experienced in and able to teach?
I am a software tester in manual testing. I want to learn automation testing and for this, we use Python in combination with Selenium. I'd like to learn some basics of Python so I can apply this knowledge to automation testing. Would you be able to help with this? Thank you.
I'm programming a script to scrape data from Google Maps, extracting contact information from various businesses to offer them my assistance. I have a digital marketing agency. The code is working, but it only scrapes the first 5 or 10 businesses. I don't know how to implement scrolling to gather all of them, and in this regard, I need help. I'm sure that for you, this will be a piece of cake and you'll be able to solve it in no time. I can share the code with you and you can let me know how much you would charge. I don't have much time for a call.  Best regards, Aser
